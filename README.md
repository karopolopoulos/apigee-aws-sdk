# Apigee AWS SDK

This package is primarily focused at enabling Apigee users to integrate with AWS services directly from a [JavaScript Policy](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/javascript-policy).

Although there are already many great libraries that allow integration into AWS services (including the actual [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk)!) I found that the situation I was in did not allow me to use them :sob: :rage:.

Key things about why I made this:

- Javascript Policy is the only viable option for me
- The engine used is [Rhino JavaScript engine 1.7.7.1](https://docs.apigee.com/release/supported-software.html#apigeeedgecloud-javascript)
- There are limitations with the current JS version
  - Methods cannot exceed 64kb - [generated bytecode for method exceeds 64K limit](http://www.programmersought.com/article/5394215653/)
  - ES2015 features and beyond are not supported (including Typed Array) - [Rhino ES2015 Support](https://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html)

## Installation

```shell
npm install apigee-aws-sdk
```

## Examples

### Importing

```js
// import entire SDK
var apigeeAwsSdk = require('apigee-aws-sdk');
// import individual modules
var Lambda = require('apigee-aws-sdk/modules/lambda');
```

### Usage

```js
var Lambda = require('apigee-aws-sdk/modules/lambda');

var options = {
  accessKeyId: '<value>',
  secretAccessKey: '<value>',
  region: '<value>'
};
var lambda = new Lambda(options);

var params = {
  functionName: 'hello-world',
  payload: <string>
};
lambda.invoke(params, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log(data)
  }
});
```

### Bundling for Apigee

Apigee does not allow you to import packages from a package manager for a Javascript Policy. Instead all the files must be uploaded together before deployment.

## API

### Lambda

#### new Lambda(options)

Creates a new Lambda object.

Parameters:

- **options** **`Object`**
  - accessKeyId `String` - your AWS access key ID
  - secretAccessKey `String` - your AWS secret key
  - region `String` - your AWS region

#### lambda.invoke(params)

Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the response), or asynchronously.

Parameters:

- **params** **`Object`**
  - FunctionName `String` **required** - the name of your lambda function
  - Payload `String` - The stringified JSON that you want to provide to your Lambda function as input
  - InvocationType `String` - how you would like to invoke your function. Choose from:
    - `RequestResponse` (default) - invoke lambda synchronously
    - `Event` - invoke lambda asynchronously
    - `DryRun` - validate parameters without invoking lambda
  - LogType `String` - include details of the execution log in your response. Choose from:
    - `None` - don't supply any logs
    - `Tail` - include logs
  - ClientContext `String` - up to 3583 bytes of base64-encoded data about the invoking client to pass to the function in the context object
  - Qualifier `String` - specify a version or alias to invoke a published version of the function

Callback:

- **err** **`Error`** - the error object returned from the request. Set to null if the request is successful
- **data** **`Object`** - the data object returned from the request. Set to null if the request failed
  - StatusCode `Integer` - the HTTP status code is in the 200 range for a successful request
  - FunctionError `String` - if present, indicates that an error occurred during function execution. Options:
    - `Handled` - the runtime caught an error thrown by the function and formatted it into a JSON document
    - `Unhandled` - The runtime didn't handle the error. For example, the function ran out of memory or timed out
  - LogResult `String` - the last 4 KB of the execution log, which is base64 encoded
  - Payload `Buffer` - the response from the function, or an error object
  - ExecutedVersion `String` - the version of the function that executed

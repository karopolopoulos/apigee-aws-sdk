# AWS SDK Light

This package is primarily focused at enabling Apigee users to integrate with AWS services directly from a [JavaScript Policy](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/javascript-policy). However it can certainly be used by anyone.

Although there are already many great libraries that allow integration into AWS services (including the actual [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk)!) I found that the situation I was in did not allow me to use them :sob: :rage:.

Key things about why I made this:

- Javascript Policy is the only viable option for me
- The engine used is [Rhino JavaScript engine 1.7.7.1](https://docs.apigee.com/release/supported-software.html#apigeeedgecloud-javascript)
- There are limitations with the current JS version
  - Methods cannot exceed 64kb - [generated bytecode for method exceeds 64K limit](http://www.programmersought.com/article/5394215653/)
  - ES2015 features and beyond are not supported (including Typed Array) - [Rhino ES2015 Support](https://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html)
